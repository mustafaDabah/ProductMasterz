- Our API now supports adding HTML tags to articles. This feature allows users to format their articles with HTML tags, providing more flexibility and control over the appearance of their content.

- To use this feature, users can add any valid HTML tag to their article content. For example, the following HTML code can be used to create a section with a heading, paragraph, unordered list, and horizontal line:

```python
 ### you can follow this stucture .  
 - use h3 to add header .
 - use p to write paragraph.
 - use ul to make list with items .
 - use li to add make item list . 
 - use hr to make line. 

### Example
  <h3>Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Repellat, fugiat.</h3> 
  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Fac.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</li>
    <li>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</li>
    <li>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</li>
    <li>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</li>
  </ul>
  <hr />
  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. t ab!</p>
```
Users can add this code to their article content, and the HTML tags will be parsed and rendered in the output.
